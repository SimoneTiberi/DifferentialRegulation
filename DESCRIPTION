Title: Differentially regulated genes from scRNA-seq data

Description: DifferentialRegulation is a method for detecting differentially regulated genes between two groups of samples 
  (e.g., healthy vs. disease, or treated vs. untreated samples), by targeting differences in the balance of spliced and unspliced mRNA abundances, 
  obtained from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data.
  DifferentialRegulation accounts for the sample-to-sample variability, and embeds multiple samples in a Bayesian hierarchical model.
  For reads compatible with multiple genes (or )
  Parameters are inferred via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques (Metropolis-within-Gibbs).
